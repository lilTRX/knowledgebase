- ## Homework
- ### Problem 1
- a
	- the value of 0 of f(0) minimizes the distance to the 0 punkt
	- taking the half of a negative number makes it bigger not smaller, this would obfuscate the result
- b
	- f(x) is the the "positive sum" of all x so basically flips all x to be positive and then sums them
	- g(x) give us the bigger sum of either all negativly fliped x values or the sum of the x values as is
	- f(x) is always greater but i dont know how to show this with math, the idea is that f(x)-g(x) >=0
- c
	- 1 in 6 to stop
	- 1 in 6 to get a
	- 1 in 6 to get b
	- Expected value = (probability of scoring b points) x (b points) + (probability of losing a point) x (-a points) + (probability of scoring 0 points) x (0 points)
	- Expected value = (1/6) x (b) + (1/6) x (-a) + (4/6) x (0)
	- Expected value = (b-a)/6
- d
