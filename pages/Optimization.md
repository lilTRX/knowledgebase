- What are the two types of optimizations we can use?
	- Discrete optimization: find the best discrete object

		- Algorythimc tool: dynamic programming
	- Continuous optimization: find the best vector of real numbers

		- Algorythmic tool: gradient descent
- Regression sum

	- we have a function (the red line)
- ## Principle: Reduce the problem
- Find the possible actions that can be performed
- Find the costs of each problem
- use caches to save known subsolutions
	- with cache we pay for the number or nodes not the number of paths
- abstract away the details
